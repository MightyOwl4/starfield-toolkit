# Specification Quality Checklist: Description Dependency Parser

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-04-05
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- All items pass validation.
- Two user stories: P1 (parser + rule book generation), P2 (confidence scoring + report).
- Depends on: 005 (catalogue data), 007 (rule book format).
- Three pattern types to detect: explicit filename lists, named orders with filenames, informal hints.
- Spec is ready for `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`.
